# Webdriver Downloader IntelliJ Plugin

This is a demo plugin capable of downloading a Selenium Webdriver file for
a specified browser and a current platform.
At the moment, only two browsers are supported:
+ Chrome
+ Firefox

> The code of this plugin intentionally contains some issues so that it may be
> an appropriate playground for testing Platform-related features.
